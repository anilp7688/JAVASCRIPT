Tom and Adam played 3 rounds of basketball against each other. Tom scored 51, 32 and 60 points, whereas Adam scored 44, 54 and 64 points. Calculate the average score of Tom and Adam and log to the console the winner. 

1) Store each score in a variable with a sensible name. 

2) Calculate the average of the three scores for each player and store the result in a variable.

3) Using an if... else statement or a switch statement, log to the console the winner based on the average scores. Remember, you need to account for a tie as well!

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of a person's weight compared to their height. The formula for BMI is:

BMI = weight / height * height
Where weight is in kg and height is in m.

Tom has a weight of 75.5kg and a height of 1.74m. Adam has a weight of 81.2kg and has a height of 1.88m. Calculate each of their BMI's and log to the console who has the higher BMI.

1) Store weights and heights of Tom and Adam in sensibly named variables.

2) Calculate each of their BMI's using the formula mentioned above and store them in separate variables.

3) Use a conditional statement to log to the console who has the higher BMI.
