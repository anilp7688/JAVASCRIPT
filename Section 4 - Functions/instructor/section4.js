/*
Tom has a weight of 75.5kg and a height of 1.74m. Adam has a weight of 81.2kg and has a height of 1.88m. 

The formula for BMI is:

BMI = weight / height * height
Where weight is in kg and height is in m.

Create a function that accepts two arguments, weight and height, and returns the BMI. Calculate the BMI of both Tom and Adam using the function and store them in variables. Log to the console their BMI's.

Ben went to three different restaurants in the past week. The first restaurant gave him a bill of $58. The second restaurant gave him a bill of $22. The third restaurant gave him a bill of $104. 

Ben usually tips depending on the amount of the bill. If the bill is less than $50, he tips 10%. If the bill is between 50 and 100 inclusive, he tips 15%. Finally, if the bill is over $100, he tips 20%. 

Create a function called tipCalculator that accepts one argument and returns the tip amount based on the conditions mentioned and calculate the tip amounts that Adam has to pay for each bill.

B = 75-89
C = 60-74
D = 50-59
F = 0-49

Create a function called dice that takes in no arguments. This function should return a random number between 1 and 6. 

Call the dice function twice and store them in variables called dice1 and dice2. 

Write a conditional statement that logs to the console the value of each die and which die has the greater value. 

You will have to google how to generate a random number between 1 and 6 and how to round the number so you get a whole number each time.
